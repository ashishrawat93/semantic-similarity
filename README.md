## NOTE

The submission contains the following files:
- README
- FinalProject Report
- Zip folder containing the code files

We have not included the dataset with this submission, since it was a very large folder, and we were running into problems zipping the data.

## DATASET

However, the Quora Question Pairs dataset can be found using the following link:
https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs

Also, we have also not included the Student Questions dataset that we generated, since 
that data is sensitive to the product we are trying to create.

## TO RUN

1. Unzip the final_proj.zip
2. Change Directory using `cd final_proj/project`
3. Run `python train.py my_model`
